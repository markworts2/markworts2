- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @markworts2
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an Infrastructure consultant with more years of enterprise experience than I like to count, outside of that I'm interested in infrastructure as code and am looking to use this site do a bit of practice and learning. If it goes well I'm going to try and create a useful library of templates and share my learnings!

- If you have an Infrastructure automation template your want to share, please share!
